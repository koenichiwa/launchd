# launchd
A Rust library for creating and parsing Launchd files.

## Disclaimers
It's still in early development and all help is welcome.

The syntax for building launchd files is still subject for change. 
Launchd has a lot of properties, and I'm considering using [derive_builder](https://docs.rs/derive_builder/0.9.0/derive_builder/) or something similar to reduce boilerplate code, and increase maintainability. I'm hoping to have made that decision by `v0.4.0`. Suggestions are [welcome](https://github.com/koenichiwa/launchd/issues/1)!

The `Launchd` struct is not yet complete. The fields are not public by design, so I can add (but not delete) fields through patches, without the need to create a new minor version.

This library is largely untested. This is not a huge issue for the majority of the program. The only real issue is with the `cron` feature.

I'm still thinking about what should happen if uninitialized `CalendarInterval`s are added to the struct. Should an exception be thrown, should they silently be filtered out, or should I leave that responsibility to the user. For now it's your own responsibility, but that behaviour might change in the future.

## FAQ
### What is Launchd?
Launchd is MacOS's way of scheduling programs and services to be ran.

For more information: [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launchd).

For a more detailed description of the parameters run `man launchd.plist` on your Apple computer or check out: [manpagez](https://www.manpagez.com/man/5/launchd.plist/) or [xcode-man-pages](https://keith.github.io/xcode-man-pages/launchd.plist.5.html).

### Why not cron?
MacOS deprecated cron, the previous way of scheduling programs.

This library also provides a way of parsing crontabs to `CalendarInterval`s when the `cron` feature is selected.
**Disclaimer**: this feature is still untested.

### Why not systemd?
Due to licensing issues MacOS does not support systemd. 
The parsing of systemd is not included in this library.

## Usage
Add this to your Cargo.toml dependencies:
``` toml
launchd = "0.3.0"
```

## Features
### Default
``` toml
launchd = {version = "0.3.0", features=["io"]}
```
### Translate crontabs
``` toml
launchd = {version = "0.3.0", features=["cron"]}
```
### Without the plist writer
``` toml
launchd = {version = "0.3.0", default-features = false, features=["serde"]}
```

## Example

``` rust
use std::path::Path;
use launchd::{CalendarInterval, Error, Launchd};
fn main() -> Result<(), Error> {
    let ci = CalendarInterval::default()
        .with_hour(12)?
        .with_minute(10)?
        .with_weekday(7)?;

    let launchd = Launchd::new("LABEL", Path::new("./foo/bar.txt"))?
            .with_user_name("Henk")
            .with_program_arguments(vec!["Hello".to_string(), "World!".to_string()])
            .with_start_calendar_intervals(vec![ci])
            .disabled();
    
    launchd.to_writer_xml(std::io::stdout())
}
```

Results in:
